# DeepBind-with-PyTorch 

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a DeepBind model that came out in 2015. I implemented the model described in the paper ["Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3300) with the use of Pytorch. The detailed explanation of the architecture can be found in the [supplementary notes of the paper](https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/nbt/journal/v33/n8/extref/nbt.3300-S2.pdf). 

The architecture of the model and the calibration phase steps are explained in this figure from the paper:
